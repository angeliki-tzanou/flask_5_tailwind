# Week 5 HW: Video Hosting, Flask App and Cloud Deployment:

## 1. Video Creation:
- First found a video or a clip that I wanted to include into my flask app with the theme I had chosen.
- Went on Youtube, found an appropriate clip that was less than 60 sec, and also permitted downloads and downloaded in an mp4 format.
- After doing so the platform I chose was Azure so I logged in and prepared to upload the video and image I wanted to include in my flask app.

## 2. Cloud CDN & Uploading/Video Hosting:
- Went into Azure and created a resource group in which we can store everything for this app
    - Such as: CDN, container, webapp

- After creating the resource went ahead and created a CDN instance
